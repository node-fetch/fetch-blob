### Fixed
- Allow usage of iterable object in Blob constructor. [#108]
- Run test WPT test against our impl [#109]
- File name are now casted to string [#109]
- Slicing in the middle of multiple parts added more bytes than what what it should have [#109]
- Prefixed `stream/web` import with `node:` to allow easier static analysis detection of Node built-ins [#122]
- Added `node:` prefix in `from.js` as well [#114]
- Suppress warning when importing `stream/web` [#114]

## v3.1.2

- Improved typing
- Fixed a bug where position in iterator did not increase

## v3.1.0
- started to use real whatwg streams
- degraded fs/promise to fs.promise to support node v12
- degraded optional changing to support node v12

## v3.0.0
- Changed WeakMap for private field (require node 12)
- Switch to ESM
- blob.stream() return a subset of whatwg stream which is the async iterable part
  (it no longer return a node stream)
- Reduced the dependency of Buffer by changing to global TextEncoder/Decoder (require node 11)
- Disabled xo since it could understand private fields (#)
- No longer transform the type to lowercase (https://github.com/w3c/FileAPI/issues/43)
  This is more loose than strict, keys should be lowercased, but values should not.
  It would require a more proper mime type parser - so we just made it loose.
- index.js and file.js can now be imported by browser & deno since it no longer depends on any
  core node features (but why would you?)
- Implemented a File class
